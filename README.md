# 💹📈 Minimalistic Trading Portfolio App 📉📊

Built this little project to flex my frontend muscles and play around with crypto data.

### ✨ What it does

Pulls live(ish) crypto info from the Coingecko API

Shows key stats + charts for the top 100 coins

Keeps track of a mini portfolio (BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE gang 🐶🚀)

Visualizes your portfolio allocation with a slick donut chart

Lets you build a watchlist of up to 10 coins and track their moves (1d, 7d, 30d, 1y)

All wrapped up with shadcn/ui, React, and Chart.js goodness

### 🛠️ Stack

React ⚛️

shadcn/ui for clean UI 🎨

Chart.js for tasty charts 📊

Coingecko API for crypto data 💰

### 🍾 Future Enhancements

Real-time pricing (Coingecko free tier = stingy limits → need to build my own backend with websocket/sse)

Dark 🌙 & Light ☀️ mode

Fully responsive layouts 📱

Auth (because everyone loves sign-ups, right?)

Customizable user profiles 🖼️

AI-powered chatbot buddy 🤖

Latest crypto news feed 📰

Glassmorphism UI ✨ (fancy but heavy on the css rendering)
