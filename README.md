# 💹📈 Minimalistic Trading Portfolio App 📉📊

Built this little project to flex my frontend muscles and play around with crypto data.

⚠️⛔ Coingecko is stingy with their API limits. So the app might fail to fetch data after 10 requests in a minute. A localstorage based solution to retain previous state is on the roadmap. ⛔⚠️ 

### ✨ What it does

Pulls live(ish) crypto info from the Coingecko API

Shows key stats + charts for the top 100 coins

Keeps track of a mini portfolio (BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE gang 🐶🚀)

Visualizes your portfolio allocation with a slick donut chart

Lets you build a watchlist of up to 10 coins and track their moves (1d, 7d, 30d, 1y)

All wrapped up with shadcn/ui, React, and Chart.js goodness

### 🛠️ Stack

React ⚛️

shadcn/ui for clean UI 🎨

Chart.js for tasty charts 📊
